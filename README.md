# Bagel (Fork)

This is my fork of **Bagel**, set up to run on multi-gpu inside [runpod.io](https://runpod.io) pod using the custom image:

```
madiator2011/better-pytorch\:cuda12.4-torch2.6.0
````

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to open port `7860`.  
> RunPod users: set **`7777,7680`** in the pod's port field, if you want to use gradio ui.

I have specially compiled **FlashAttention** for this setup and provided an installation script in the [Installation Notebook](./install.ipynb).

---

## üöÄ Main Contribution

- Added **multi-GPU support** in both [`app.py`](./app.py) and [`inference.ipynb`](./inference.ipynb).
- With help from **Gemini 2.5**, the model now supports multi-GPU inference.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance and System Requirements

with A40x2 machine the model was taking 64GB and inference was around 2 minutes per image.  

---

## üìñ How to Use

Inside your pod, download the [Raw Installation Notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simsim314/Bagel/refs/heads/main/install.ipynb):

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simsim314/Bagel/refs/heads/main/install.ipynb
````

Run all commands inside the notebook.

Then you can either:

* Run the Jupyter notebook: [inference.ipynb](./inference.ipynb)

* Or launch the Gradio UI [app.py](./app.py):

  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

The rest should be self-explanatory.

> We present **BAGEL**, an open‚Äësource multimodal foundation model with 7B active parameters (14B total) trained on large‚Äëscale interleaved multimodal data. BAGEL outperforms the current top‚Äëtier open‚Äësource VLMs like Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL-2.5 on standard multimodal understanding leaderboards, and delivers text‚Äëto‚Äëimage quality that is competitive with strong specialist generators such as SD3.
Moreover, BAGEL demonstrates superior qualitative results in classical image‚Äëediting scenarios than the leading open-source models. More importantly, it extends to free-form visual manipulation, multiview synthesis, and world navigation, capabilities that constitute "world-modeling" tasks beyond the scope of previous image-editing models.
The figure below showcases BAGEL's qualitative performance.

<!-- ## üß† Method
BAGEL adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer-Experts (MoT) architecture to maximize the model‚Äôs capacity to learn from richly diverse multimodal information. Following the same principle of capacity maximization, it utilizes two separate encoders to capture pixel-level and semantic-level features of an image. The overall framework follows a Next Group of Token Prediction paradigm, where the model is trained to predict the next group of language or visual tokens as a compression target.

BAGEL scales MoT‚Äôs capacity through Pre-training, Continued Training, and Supervised Finetuning on trillions of interleaved multimodal tokens spanning language, image, video, and web data. It surpasses open models on standard understanding and generation benchmarks and demonstrates advanced in-context multimodal abilities like free-form image editing, future frame prediction, 3D manipulation, world navigation, and sequential reasoning.

## üå± Emerging Properties
<p align="center"><img src="assets/emerging_curves.png" width="95%"></p>

As we scale up BAGEL‚Äôs pretraining with more multimodal tokens, we observe consistent performance gains across understanding, generation, and editing tasks. Different capabilities emerge at distinct training stages‚Äîmultimodal understanding and generation appear early, followed by basic editing, while complex, intelligent editing emerges later. This staged progression suggests an emergent pattern, where advanced multimodal reasoning builds on well-formed foundational skills. Ablation studies further show that combining VAE and ViT features significantly improves intelligent editing, underscoring the importance of visual-semantic context in enabling complex multimodal reasoning and further supporting its role in the emergence of advanced capabilities. -->

## üìÆ Notice
**Call for Bad Cases:** If you have encountered any cases where the model performs poorly, we would greatly appreciate it if you could share them in the [issue#11](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Bagel/issues/11) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z836xxzy).

**About Inference Hyperparameters:**
- **`cfg_text_scale`:** Controls how strongly the model follows the text prompt. `1.0` disables text guidance. Typical range: `4.0‚Äì8.0`.
- **`cfg_image_scale`:** Controls how much the model preserves input image details. `1.0` disables image guidance. Typical range: `1.0‚Äì2.0`.
- **`cfg_interval`:** Fraction of denoising steps where CFG is applied. Later steps can skip CFG to reduce computation. Typical: `[0.4, 1.0]`.
- **`timestep_shift`:** Shifts the distribution of denoising steps. Higher values allocate more steps at the start (affects layout); lower values allocate more at the end (improves details).
- **`num_timesteps`:** Total denoising steps. Typical: `50`.
- **`cfg_renorm_min`:** Minimum value for CFG-Renorm. `1.0` disables renorm. Typical: `0`.
- **`cfg_renorm_type`:** CFG-Renorm method:  
  - `global`: Normalize over all tokens and channels (default for T2I).
  - `channel`: Normalize across channels for each token.
  - `text_channel`: Like `channel`, but only applies to text condition (good for editing, may cause blur).
- **If edited images appear blurry, try `global` CFG-Renorm, decrease `cfg_renorm_min` or decrease `cfg_scale`.**
